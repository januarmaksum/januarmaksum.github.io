        HelloðŸ‘‹ I&apos;m Januar. I started my career working in the B2B
        marketplace in 2014 as a web designer and 1 year later switch career to
        frontend developer. My interest in visuals and code made me learn a lot
        about using supporting tools, such as software Visual Studio Code.

        Equipped with knowledge from studying informatics engineering, I
        understand how systems work behind the scenes until they are presented
        to users. Understand the basic framework of programming languages, for
        example HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

        As a frontend developer, I have more than 9 years of experience in
        building modern and user-friendly web applications. Proficient in web
        development technologies, with a strong focus on performance, stability
        and maintainability.
